Hey there ‚Äî thanks for stopping by!

I‚Äôm **Loan Dumenoir**, a 23-year-old engineer who works where networking meets software.

**How did I end up here?**

* It began in high-school electronics labs, soldering boards and writing tiny C routines to chat over **I¬≤C** and **CAN**.  
* Curiosity pushed me toward wireless home-automation (ZigBee / LoRa) and, inevitably, full-blown IP. Wanting to grasp what we casually call ‚Äúthe Internet‚Äù ‚Äî and how to run routers and switches not just in an enterprise closet but at service-provider scale ‚Äî I became hooked on how packets travel, dissecting protocols such as BGP, MPLS and RSTP.
* I also spent evenings on Root-Me. Far from a CTF prodigy, I gained a lot by dismantling OWASP Top 10 labs and experimenting with buffer-overflows‚Äîseeing how things really break at the lowest level and how to avoid those pitfalls.

After a few internships and a graduation project, I moved from traditional IT ops to what we now call **NetDevOps** ‚Äî bringing CI/CD discipline, version control and testing to routers, firewalls and data-centre fabrics.

### Why this blog?

French industry is still catching up on **NetDevOps**. I‚Äôd like to help fill the gap by sharing:

* hands-on guides;  
* real-world lessons learned ‚Äî the *misconfig* stories as well as the shiny diagrams;  
* a healthy dose of troubleshooting notes so Google can index them for the next unlucky soul.

If you‚Äôre into automating networks rather than clicking through GUIs, you‚Äôll feel at home.

### Off duty

Ice-skating, swimming and regular workouts keep my brain functional.  
When I‚Äôm not at the rink or the pool you‚Äôll find me **spoiling two rabbits** and an unreasonable number of houseplants. üåø
